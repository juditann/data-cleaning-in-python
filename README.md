- There is a positive correlation between an audiobook's duration and price. However, correlation doesn't mean causation. Other factors that could affect an audiobook's price could be the popularity of a book's author, the popularity of a narrator, whether an audiobook was translated, and any additional offers/sales placed on the book by Audible or the book's publisher.[add graph below this paragraph]
